# k-Diff-things
This does calculations for canonical k-coverings of polygons and whatnot. There is not much here now except a tool for calculating cone angles. Later there will be more stuff. Currently you can calculate the stratum of a cannonical K-covering for a polyhedron and thats about it. 
The next thing to add is going to be a converter to print output data as nice looking LaTex write ups so you I can put a bumch of this information in a nice big table. Ill probably also add tools for getting a bit more information about K-coverings. In particualr, I'll add something to calculate subsurfaces which tessilate K-coverings.
A little later I will also add some stuff to make pictures.
