# k-Diff-things
This does calculations for canonical k-coverings of flat surfaces.

There is a nice tool for calculating cone angles, currently you can calculate the stratum of a cannonical K-covering for a polyhedron, make a file containing data for any number of polyhedra and load that file into the calculator to get all kinds of interesting covering data as output.

The next thing to add is going to be a converter to print output data as nice looking LaTex for tables ect.
I also need to a dd something to calculate subsurfaces which tessilate K-coverings.
A little later I will also add some stuff to make pictures.
